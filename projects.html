<h2> Pharo</h2>

<p>
I'm involved in the Pharo open-source community. <a href="http://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback.
Pharo is a Smalltalk-inspired language that offers strong live programming features such as immediate object manipulation, live update, hot recompilation. Live programming environment is in the heart of the system.
My Pharo projects are hosted in my <a href="http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~GustavoSantos">SmalltalkHub</a>’s account.

<h2> TopicViewer</h2>

<p>
TopicViewer is a Java open-source tool that uses Latent Semantic Indexing and Hierarchical Clustering to attain groups of similar architectural entities of a software system, according to their vocabularies. The vocabulary is extracted from any source of information (bug and task reports, high-level documentation etc.). It also provides a visualization to show how these similar groups are distributed over the system’s architecture. TopicViewer is available (temporarily) in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/topic-viewer/">GoogleCode</a>
